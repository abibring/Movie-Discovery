# Movie-Discovery
This application uses The Movie Database API to let users search for movies out in the theater.  Users can search for movies based on genre and save their favorite movies to view later.  Movie search results are returned to the user based on popularity, so that the most popular movies within the search will be shown first.

## To Run Locally:
Clone the repo.  You must acquire an API key from [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US).  Copy the API key into the config.js file (this file should be located at the root directory level). Then,

> npm install

> npm run react-dev
> npm run server-dev
